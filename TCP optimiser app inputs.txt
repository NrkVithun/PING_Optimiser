I'll compile a comprehensive list of the network and TCP/IP settings modified in the video:

Network Adapter Settings (Advanced Properties):
1. Power Management
- Uncheck power management options

2. Disabled Advanced Settings:
- Adaptive interframe spacing
- ARP offload
- PME (Power Management Event)
- Energy efficient ethernet
- Flow control

3. Kept Enabled:
- Gigabit Master Slave mode
- Gigabit physical mode
- Autodetect

4. Interrupt and Moderation Settings:
- Disabled interrupt moderation
- Disabled moderation rate

5. Offload Settings (All Turned Off):
- IPv4 checksum offload
- Jumbo packet
- LSO (Large Send Offload) for IPv4 and IPv6
- TCP checksum offload
- UDP checksum offload

6. Buffer Settings:
- Receive buffers set to 2048 (or 512/1024)
- Transmit buffers matched/scaled with receive buffers
- Recommended ratio: transmit buffers should be double receive buffers

7. Other Network Adapter Settings:
- Disabled locally administered address
- Disabled log link state event
- Max number of RSS queues set to 2
- Enabled packet priority in VLAN
- Disabled PTP Hardware timestamp
- Disabled software timestamp
- Speed and duplex set to auto-negotiation or highest full duplex

TCP Optimizer Settings:
1. TCP/IP Advanced Tuning:
- Auto-tuning disabled
- Scaling heuristics disabled
- Congestion control provider: CTCP
- RSS (Receive-Side Scaling) disabled
- Time to live set to 64
- NC capability enabled
- Checksum offloading disabled
- Chimney offload disabled
- LSO disabled
- TCP 1323 timestamps enabled

2. Connection Parameters:
- Max connections per server: 10
- Local priority: 4
- Host priority: 5
- DNS priority: 6
- Net priority: 7
- Max SYN retransmissions: 2
- Non-SAC resiliency: disabled
- Initial RTO (Retransmission Timeout): 2000
- Minimum RTO: 300
- QoS non-best effort limit: 0
- Network throttling index: disabled
- System responsiveness: gaming mode
- Large system cache: enabled (optimized max)
- Max user ports: 65534
- TCP timed delay: 30

Additional Tweaks:
- DNS changed to Cloudflare (1.0.0.1)
- Network adapter onboard processor enabled
- Create system restore point before modifications

This comprehensive list covers nearly all the network and TCP/IP optimizations mentioned in the video for improving gaming performance and reducing ping.
